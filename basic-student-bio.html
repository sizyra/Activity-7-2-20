    <p>I was born in 1994 in West Lafayette, Indiana. We moved to Maryland when I was around six months old, then to Norman, Oklahoma when I was four. We lived there for ten years before moving back to Indiana, this time to Bloomington.</p>
    <p>We settled in two weeks before my freshman year of high school. I lived there for over a decade before graduating from IU East, and I got married a day later - my Virtual background is the wedding venue, designed and decorated by us personally. We now live in Beaverton, Oregon with our two cats, Millie and Momo.</p>
